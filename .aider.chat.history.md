Simple Biology Quiz App Structure:
The app includes a Home Screen with buttons for Start Quiz, Categories, and Progress. Categories contain basic topics such as Cells, Genetics, Anatomy, Ecology, and Microbiology. The Quiz Screen shows a question, multiple-choice options, and a Next button (with optional timer). After finishing, the Results Screen displays the score, correct answers, and a review of mistakes. A simple Profile page shows name, level, and quiz history, and a Settings page allows toggling sound and dark mode.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’ll need to make to get the app working and to update the logo and metadata are:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to describe the logo image that should be generated.  

If you want to add the quiz screens, categories, profile, and settings pages, you’ll need to create new component files under `mini-app/components` and import them in the appropriate routes, but those are separate additions that you can add later.
